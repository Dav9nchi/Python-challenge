Instructions In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values: -->
<!-- The total number of months included in the dataset --> first class 2:07:30 lists    
<!-- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period -->
<!-- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes -->
<!-- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period -->
<!-- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period -->
<!-- Your analysis should align with the following results: -->
